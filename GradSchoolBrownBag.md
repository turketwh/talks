* Sometimes see:
  - Mid-fall for spring admissions
  - Rolling deadlines

# How To Finance

---

Financial support

* In many research-focused programs, can get paid to go to graduate school
* Admitted applicants may receive:
    - Tuition reduction
    - Assistantship

---

Common types of support

* Tuition reduction
  - A scholarship that pays some significant portion of tuition for you
* Assistantships (TAs)
  - Teaching assistantships (teaching labs, grading, ...)

---

Common types of support

* Research assistantships (RAs)
  - Assisting faculty in research
  - Common to move to an RA in later years of grad program

---

Other types of support

* Fellowships
  - School/federal/philanthropic
  - Often merit-based
* Loans
  - Government and private

---

Other types of support

* *Executive* degrees:
  - Some businesses will support/pay for you to get a M.S.
  - Some businesses (& the govt.) will pay for you to get a Ph.D.
  - May come with expectations for paying back

---

Caveat

* More difficult to get funding if you enroll at a Ph.D.-granting school as a M.S.-only student

---

Assistantships

* Funding is *livable*, not *luxurious*
* Amounts may depend on:
  - Cost of living
  - M.S. or Ph.D.
  - Type of assistantship
* One example: UNC PhD assistantships: $22,000

# Degree Options

# Choosing A School

---

Things to consider in choosing a school

* In no particular order
  - Location (contacts, internships, weather)
  - Size
  - Research areas of interest
  - Researchers of interest


---

More things to consider in choosing a school

* M.S.-only vs M.S. & Ph.D.
* Interdisciplinarity
* For Ph.D., schools typically excel in certain sub-areas
    - Best school in robotics is not the best school in graphics
